## TourMan
## About:
My assignment 10 of programming hero, b9. Focused on crud using mongodb. Here, in backend, I will do crud operations using mongodb atlas, expressjs. In frontend I have used react. Details are inside frontend repo.

## Links:
  - My frontend repo: [pha10-tourman-client](https://github.com/rahatfaruk/pha10-tourman-client) , [phero-repo](https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course-4/B9A10-client-side-rahatfaruk) 

## How can you run backend locally:
  - clone this repo
  - create `.env` file in root folder. redefine these keys with your own values: mongodb username and passwors (`Password, User`)
  - uncomment `await client.connect()` line inside 'index.js'.
  - run project: `npm run dev`
